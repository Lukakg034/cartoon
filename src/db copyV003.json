Using some of the magic of the Lemurian Arcana, Skullmaster causes the balance in Hydra to tip in favor of darkness. However, Warmonger takes this chance to betray Skullmaster by keeping the page of control from the book for himself and orders Hydra to destroy Skullmaster. Max, Virgil, and Norman show up in time to realize what is happening and attempt to protect Skullmaster out of fear that it will disrupt the prophecy since Max is destined to defeat Skullmaster. They fail to protect Skullmaster who is seemingly killed and Max is forced to use the most powerful page that they had obtained from the Arcana in order to put the light energy of Hydra back in balance. The island sinks as a result and Warmonger escapes only to find out that Skullmaster had arranged all this to force Max to use his page of the Arcana, the one thing he feared most. Skullmaster promises that Warmonger will be rewarded for his loyalty later on.",

Virgil and Norman show up at Max's birthday party to show him the prophecy in their home in the Himalayas Mountains. There, they reveal to him that the Prophecy is a set of murals that have been predicting the future based on current events and it now shows that Skullmaster is ready to begin his conquest of the world. Skullmaster and Warmonger launch a surprise attack on the three in their home leaving them with no choice but to run. As they are running, Virgil informs Max that they must evade Skullmaster until after the Winter Solstice or else Skullmaster will win. As they flee from portal to portal, they encounter previously defeated monsters Eye of Cyclops controlling the Cyclops skeleton and Cyberskull who were revived by and under Skullmaster's control. Eventually, they encounter Arachnoid's giant mutated spider they had previously fought and Norman had a fear against as this time Norman realizes that his destiny is about to conclude.",

Max resists leaving Norman to die, but Virgil forces him to flee explaining to him that this moment was foretold on by the prophecy; the mural in their home. After fleeing, Max is furious that Virgil let Norman die upon which Virgil explains that each person's end is foretold and that Virgil's end will be at Stonehenge, a place Max must avoid until after the solstice. Skullmaster and Warmonger show up again, and in order to save Max, Virgil sends him to the Astral Plane, the one place Skullmaster cannot follow. Skullmaster abducts Virgil and takes him to Stonehenge while relaying a message to Max through Talon (the monster in the Astral Plane) that if he fails to show up, he will kill Virgil. Desperate for help, Max heads to Skull Mountain to recruit Lava Lord's help in getting revenge on Skullmaster. Lava Lord takes his new and improved Magus to Stonehenge with Max. Skullmaster summons Fuath to battle with Lava Lord and Magus while Max attempts to save Virgil. After Fuath is defeated, Skullmaster overcomes Lava Lord and Magus with the power of the Crystal of Souls and then demands that Max hand over the cosmic cap in exchange for Virgil's life. Despite Virgil's protest, Max agrees upon which Skullmaster kills Virgil and orders Warmonger to restrain Max while he explains what is about to happen. Now with the Cosmic Cap (which changes into a cosmic crown) and Crystal of Souls, Skullmaster stands in the center of Stonehenge, where he absorbs the powers of time itself on the sunset of the winter solstice and is able to rewrite the past, present, and future. While Warmonger has been killed by Skullmaster as part of the reward that Skullmaster promised Warmonger, Max grabs a hold of the staff with the Crystal of Souls. Using his connection with the cap, Max is able to partially absorb the energy as well and uses it to reverse time back to when he first got the cap. Now back at the beginning, he realizes that he is reliving the past and decides that this time around he is going to ensure he fulfills his destiny.",
