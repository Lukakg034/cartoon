Max's mom does not seem very surprised to see a walking, talking bird creature but refuses to believe that her son is some sort of super hero (she recognizes Virgil by name, so it is conceivable that Max has introduced his new friends to his mother between episodes and she has had some time to adjust). Max and Norman are arrested when Max is accused of stealing his cap from a vendor's stand. The seller has them both thrown into the local prison at gunpoint at which Max finally convinces Norman to stop beating up the police. Meanwhile Virgil and Max's mom must work together to recover the cap after the vendor sold it. In the prison, Max and Norman are accosted by a large hulking creature named Torlak who apparently wants to feed them to the Eye of Cyclops living in the caverns beneath the prison. As usual, adventures ensue and the day is saved.",

        "description": "Another boy by the name of Maximillion is discovered by Virgil as a potential chosen one. With the prophecy being unclear as to which one is the true cap bearer, the two compete in a competition of heroic deeds in order to prove their value. Meanwhile Skullmaster works on infiltrating an ancient city in order to get a hold of the Lemurian Arcana, the most powerful book of spells in the world. Maximillion is revealed to be a spy of Skullmaster designed to get a hold of the cosmic cap in order to activate the portal into the city. Virgil eventually reveals that he moved the book 5,000 years ago at the time of Skullmaster's imprisonment, and is coerced into revealing its location in exchanges for Max's life. Skullmaster, now with the book, leaves through a portal provided by Maximillion. Before Maximillion can go through, he is tackled by Max who manages to steal away the necklace that was controlling him. With Virgil now furious at Max for allowing Skullmaster to have everything he needs to conquer the world, Max reveals that he ripped out several pages from the Arcana while Skullmaster had a hold of him. Skullmaster is furious that his victory is only bittersweet as he only has half of the book and no cosmic cap in his possession.",

However, Warmonger takes this chance to betray Skullmaster by keeping the page of control from the book for himself and orders Hydra to destroy Skullmaster. Max, Virgil, and Norman show up in time to realize what is happening and attempt to protect Skullmaster out of fear that it will disrupt the prophecy since Max is destined to defeat Skullmaster. They fail to protect Skullmaster who is seemingly killed and Max is forced to use the most powerful page that they had obtained from the Arcana in order to put the light energy of Hydra back in balance. The island sinks as a result and Warmonger escapes only to find out that Skullmaster had arranged all this to force Max to use his page of the Arcana, the one thing he feared most. Skullmaster promises that Warmonger will be rewarded for his loyalty later on.",

Max resists leaving Norman to die, but Virgil forces him to flee explaining to him that this moment was foretold on by the prophecy; the mural in their home. After fleeing, Max is furious that Virgil let Norman die upon which Virgil explains that each person's end is foretold and that Virgil's end will be at Stonehenge, a place Max must avoid until after the solstice. Skullmaster and Warmonger show up again, and in order to save Max, Virgil sends him to the Astral Plane, the one place Skullmaster cannot follow. Skullmaster abducts Virgil and takes him to Stonehenge while relaying a message to Max through Talon (the monster in the Astral Plane) that if he fails to show up, he will kill Virgil. Desperate for help, Max heads to Skull Mountain to recruit Lava Lord's help in getting revenge on Skullmaster. Lava Lord takes his new and improved Magus to Stonehenge with Max. Skullmaster summons Fuath to battle with Lava Lord and Magus while Max attempts to save Virgil. After Fuath is defeated, Skullmaster overcomes Lava Lord and Magus with the power of the Crystal of Souls and then demands that Max hand over the cosmic cap in exchange for Virgil's life. Despite Virgil's protest, Max agrees upon which Skullmaster kills Virgil and orders Warmonger to restrain Max while he explains what is about to happen. Now with the Cosmic Cap (which changes into a cosmic crown) and Crystal of Souls, Skullmaster stands in the center of Stonehenge, where he absorbs the powers of time itself on the sunset of the winter solstice and is able to rewrite the past, present, and future. While Warmonger has been killed by Skullmaster as part of the reward that Skullmaster promised Warmonger, Max grabs a hold of the staff with the Crystal of Souls. Using his connection with the cap, Max is able to partially absorb the energy as well and uses it to reverse time back to when he first got the cap. Now back at the beginning, he realizes that he is reliving the past and decides that this time around he is going to ensure he fulfills his destiny.",
